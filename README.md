# Advanced Java Programming

## üõ† Skills
- Java
- Object Oriented Programming
- Design Patterns
- User Interface

## üìù Requirements
*We want to develop a system for managing a workshop for vehicle repairs (e.g., cars, motorbikes, trucks, : : :). Each vehicle is identified by owner, vehicle type, serial number, brand, engine capacity and fuel type. The owner books a repair, rectification or addition of components. He gets a receipt with which he will have to collect the car. The status of the machine at this moment is identified as incoming". It is assumed that we have m specific mechanics for n different problems (e.g., mechanical, electrical, : : :). The mechanic (identified by a name, surname and serial number) after having completed the intervention changes the status to "exit" and updates the system by entering information on the type of problem encountered, any parts changed or added and the cost of the intervention carried out. The car owner receives a message (e.g., email, text message) about the repair, the type of problem encountered, the outcome of the repair and the cost. Upon collection, the owner makes the payment in cash or by credit card or by debit card. Develop the system ensuring a graphical interface for user and mechanic management.*

## üìñ Lessons Learned
The project allowed me to approach programming in **Java** in a practical way, applying typical concepts of the language and **object-oriented programming**, such as:
  - **Abstraction**
  - **Encapsulation**
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Polymorphism**

I had the opportunity to learn the concepts and application of **Design Patterns**, particularly:
  - The **Singleton Pattern**
  - The **Command Pattern**

I experimented with various solutions for storing information, including:
  - Connecting to an external database using **JDBC Drivers**
  - Storing data in files through **Serialization/Deserialization**

An important aspect of the project was the creation of the graphic interface, developed using:
  - **JPanel**, **JFrame**, and related components.
  - **ActionListener** for event management, utilizing **anonymous inner classes**.
